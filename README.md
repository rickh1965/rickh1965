# Home lab from scratch

## About this site

My goal is to provide a guide on building up a reasonable homelab with VLAN isolation, a seperate storage environment with backups and self hosting 
of various services with containerization. Where possible, I'll provide links to the influences I've had online to set these up. A homelab is
anything you want to make it. From 3 or 4 Raspberry pi's to old throwaway servers you got from you employer.  The goal of your homelab should be 
about you.  Either you want to host something useful like a media server for you family, or you are learning something new.

## About me

My name is Rick Hernandez. I've been an UNIX sysadmin my entire career and I wouldn't want to work in any field outside of tech. 
I went many years quite content in knowing pure, straight UNIX (later Linux) as a system administrator as it was my entire world on 
the job and didn't really keep up with the new tech as I should have.  When I finally had my "awakening" I discoevered that the entire definition 
of doing what I do had changed dramatically.

A large part of this journey was my homelab. Things are moving ever more to cloud and I am as well. I'm currently working towards my certification 
on the AWS platform.  Had it not been for my homelab, I would be learning most of the concepts for cloud for the first time on AWS. There is something
to be said for setting up a container orchestration environment on your own versus clicking a button on a GUI and 
having a fully redundant, scalable and highly available environment waiting for you. In the lab all that is up to you.
